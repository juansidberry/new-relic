## prompt:
```
write a pythong program that will 
(1) Use the kafka-consumer-groups.sh command to describe the consumer group and extract the CONSUMER-ID.
(2) Write a script to parse the consumer_group_status.txt file and extract the CONSUMER-ID values.
(3) Use the New Relic API to send the extracted CONSUMER-ID values. You can use the New Relic Telemetry SDK or directly interact with the New Relic API.
(4) In New Relic, create an alert condition based on the KafkaConsumerID event type. You can set thresholds and conditions to trigger alerts when specific CONSUMER-ID values are detected or when the count of active consumers changes.
